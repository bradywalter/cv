  <h1>Brady Sieg</h1>
  <p><i>Operations Manager & Technical Project Manager at Formos</i></p>
  <p>Brady is, first and foremost, a pretty incredible guy. He can work with
    our team overseas and make sure that everyone has the resources that they
    need. And then, at the same time, you can give him important projects and
    he can crush it with the client too. He's a one of a kind guy, I would
    recommend hiring him if you ever have the chance.Brady is, first and foremost, a pretty incredible guy. He can work with
